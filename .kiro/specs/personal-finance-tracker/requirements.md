# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a personal finance tracker - a modern, production-ready web application that helps users manage their financial life. The application will be built as a full-stack solution using Django REST Framework for the backend, Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend, and deployed on AWS infrastructure. The system will provide comprehensive transaction management, budgeting capabilities, and financial insights through an intuitive, mobile-responsive interface.
