## Usage Instructions

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Set AWS region (optional)
export AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1

# Run complete deployment
./scripts/deploy-complete.sh
```

### Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
# 1. Setup IAM roles
./scripts/setup-iam-roles.sh

# 2. Configure secrets
./scripts/setup-aws-secrets.sh

# 3. Deploy to ECS
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
./scripts/deploy-to-ecs.sh

# 4. Test deployment
./scripts/test-ecs-deployment.sh

# 5. Verify integration
export BACKEND_URL=http://your-public-ip:8000
./scripts/verify-deployment-integration.sh
```
