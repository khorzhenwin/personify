My task is to create an entire fullstack application for this. Let's run through the tech stack I will be using while taking into consideration what is specified in the challenge. For the backend we will follow what is mentioned of Django REST framework which we will then containarize and deploy onto ECS + Fargate. For the frontend we will be using NextJS with mantineUI and zustand for state management which will be deplot. For the database we will ignore the specified sqlite and just straight use the postgres RDS i have on aws that is on the free tier (i have an existing application written in go here where it can be referenced https://github.com/khorzhenwin/go-chujang/blob/master/internal/config/database-config.go). For the config wise lets setup in a way where we are straight doing for production. Local development testing where you docker compose your local containers will also be calling the production database and server. Lets split the root of the folder to `frontend/` and `backend/` to keep things neat but still in the same repository to follow a modular monorepo approach.
