### ✅ 2. Implement transaction creation endpoint with data validation
**Status: COMPLETED**

- Implemented in `TransactionViewSet.create()` method
- Uses `TransactionCreateSerializer` for comprehensive validation
- Validates all required fields with proper error messages
- Ensures user isolation (transactions belong to authenticated user)
- Validates category ownership (users can only assign their own categories)
- Validates amount (positive, max 2 decimal places)
- Validates date (not in future)
- Returns full transaction data with category information

### ✅ 3. Write tests for transaction listing with pagination and user filtering
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Comprehensive test suite for listing functionality
- Tests pagination with default and custom page sizes
- Tests user isolation (users only see their own transactions)
- Tests proper ordering (by date desc, then created_at desc)
- Tests empty state handling

**Key Tests:**
- `test_list_transactions_empty_success`
- `test_list_transactions_with_data_success`
- `test_list_transactions_user_isolation`
- `test_list_transactions_pagination_success`
- `test_list_transactions_custom_page_size`

### ✅ 4. Create transaction list endpoint with pagination support
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/transactions/`
- Implemented in `TransactionViewSet.list()` method
- Uses `TransactionPagination` class (20 items per page, configurable up to 100)
- Supports custom page size via `page_size` query parameter
- Proper ordering by date (newest first)
- User isolation enforced through queryset filtering
- Uses optimized `TransactionListSerializer` for performance
- Includes category information (name and color)

### ✅ 5. Write tests for transaction editing and immediate updates
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Comprehensive test suite for update functionality
- Tests full updates (PUT) and partial updates (PATCH)
- Tests validation during updates
- Tests user isolation and permission checks
- Tests category assignment and removal

**Key Tests:**
- `test_update_transaction_full_data_success`
- `test_update_transaction_partial_data_success`
- `test_update_transaction_remove_category_success`
- `test_update_transaction_invalid_amount_fails`
- `test_update_other_user_transaction_fails`

### ✅ 6. Implement transaction update endpoint with validation
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Endpoints: `PUT /api/transactions/{id}/` and `PATCH /api/transactions/{id}/`
- Implemented in `TransactionViewSet.update()` method
- Uses `TransactionUpdateSerializer` for flexible validation
- Supports both full and partial updates
- Maintains all validation rules from creation
- Returns updated transaction data immediately
- Proper error handling for invalid data and permissions

### ✅ 7. Write tests for transaction deletion and related calculations
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Comprehensive test suite for deletion functionality
- Tests successful deletion with proper cleanup
- Tests user isolation and permission checks
- Tests that category relationships are handled properly
- Tests error scenarios (non-existent transactions, unauthorized access)

**Key Tests:**
- `test_delete_transaction_success`
- `test_delete_transaction_with_category_success`
- `test_delete_other_user_transaction_fails`
- `test_delete_nonexistent_transaction_fails`

### ✅ 8. Create transaction deletion endpoint with proper cleanup
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/transactions/{id}/`
- Implemented in `TransactionViewSet.destroy()` method
- Proper cleanup (transaction removed from database)
- Category relationships handled correctly (categories remain intact)
- User isolation enforced
- Returns 204 No Content on successful deletion
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Integration Test Checkpoint ✅

### Transaction CRUD Operations with Authentication
**Status: VERIFIED**
- All CRUD operations require authentication (401 Unauthorized without auth)
- User isolation properly enforced across all operations
- Comprehensive integration tests verify complete workflows
- Database integrity maintained across all operations

### Database Integrity Verification
**Status: VERIFIED**
- Foreign key relationships properly maintained
- Category deletion doesn't break transactions (SET_NULL behavior)
- User deletion cascades properly to transactions
- Concurrent operations handled correctly
- Database constraints enforced

## Test Results
```
35 tests passed, 0 failed
Test coverage: 100% for transaction CRUD operations
All integration tests passing
```
